# Project description

With the surge in cybersecurity incidents, the need to safeguard our data has become more pressing than ever. In 2022, Sortlist's statistics revealed a staggering exposure of 22 billion records due to over 4,100 data breaches. In the face of this landscape, digital security has taken center stage, both for businesses and individuals, who are keen on preserving the integrity of their information.

Current reality shows that 95% of hacking incidents stem from human errors and inadequate cybersecurity practices. Among prevailing bad habits, the use of predictable and easily discoverable credentials poses a significant threat. The complexity of remembering multiple strong passwords often leads to the adoption of easily memorable identifiers, subsequently resulting in their reuse.

The DuckPass project comes to life as an innovative password manager. Its aim? To aggregate and secure these intricate passwords, all while offering a seamless and reassuring experience. In addition to introducing a single master password requirement for easy access to the platform without compromising security, DuckPass sets itself apart by providing a groundbreaking feature. Users can now determine if their credentials have been compromised in previous data breaches, further enhancing their digital security. Armed with features like generating highly secure passwords, DuckPass is a robust solution fortified by end-to-end encryption, ensuring your data's security for complete peace of mind.
